  - Inputs:
    - `source` (string)
    - `destination` (string)
  - Fails if destination exists

  - Recursively search for files/directories
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): Starting directory
    - `pattern` (string): Search pattern
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Returns full paths to matches

  - Compress a file using specified algorithm
  - Inputs:

    - `algorithm` (string): 'gzip', 'deflate', or 'brotli'
  - Saves compressed file with appropriate extension

  - Decompress a file using specified algorithm

  - Saves decompressed file without compression extension

  - Encrypt a file using AES-256-CBC
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to encrypt
    - `password` (string): Encryption password
  - Saves encrypted file with .enc extension

  - Decrypt a file encrypted with encrypt_file

    - `password` (string): Decryption password
  - Saves decrypted file without .enc extension

  - Compare two text files
  - Inputs:
    - `path1` (string): First file path
    - `path2` (string): Second file path
  - Returns differences in human-readable format

  - Search for a term within a text file
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to search
    - `searchTerm` (string): Term to search for
  - Returns matching lines with line numbers

  - Generate a hash of a file
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to hash
    - `algorithm` (string): 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256', or 'sha512'
  - Returns the hash value

  - Detect the type of a file based on its content
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Returns the detected MIME type

  - Get detailed file/directory metadata
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Returns:
    - Size
    - Creation time
